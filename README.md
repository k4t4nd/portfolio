## Education
- M.S., Business Analytics | Georgetown University (_December 2024_)								       		
- B.A., English	| The College of William & Mary (_May 2020_)	 			        		

## Projects completed throughout my time at Georgetown University include, but are not limited to:
### A+E Networks: Final Capstone Project
- Applied skills in AWS, Git, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Dash and worked collaboratively on a team to design a forecasting tool for a global broadcasting network that predicts a television premiere’s success across linear and streaming platforms.

### LinkedIn: Predictive Model & Streamlit Application
- Developed a logistic regression model based on social media data using scikitlearn, pandas, numpy, and other packages within Python. Using features such as income and martial status, the model predicts whether an individual is a LinkedIn user or not. I then developed and deployed an app in streamlit, which allows the model to make predictions on unseen data.

### GoodReads: Recommendation Algorithms & Analysis
- Performed Item-Based and User-Based Collaborative Filtering in R Studio to predict an individual's rating of an unread book using Goodreads dataset containing 980,000 user-submitted ratings across 10,000 books. Mined for association rules to examine how recommendations derived from a market basket analyses differed from those derived from collaborative filtering.

### Wilkins Regulator Company: Applied Forecasting
- As part of a team case study, conducted analysis to assess Wilkins Regulator Company's current approach to forecasting, examine product demand, and develop business recommendations through comparison of Naïve Demand, Moving Average, and ARIMA forecasting methods in R Studio.

### LendingClub: Predicting Interest Rates
- Developed Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms in R Studio and Python to predict interest rates based on historical loan data containing 100,000 observations across 24 variables. Performed an analysis of feature importance using the model with the lowest RMSE to inform business recommendations.

### BigBasket: Market Basket Analysis
- Analyzed trending grocery items and association rules in R Studio to inform a recommendation algorithm for BigBasket.

### Self-Driving Cars: Conjoint Analysis
- Predicted market share of hypothetical company using customer rankings of various vehicle profiles, such as safety, autonomy, connectivity, energy efficiency, and comfort. Performed conjoint analysis to identify important features, segment customers using k-means, and compare the predicted market share with that of Tesla and Hyundai.

### TravelBiz: 
- Developed hypothetical packages for TravelBiz by performing Principal Componets Analysis and K-Means Clustering to explore relationships between customers and gain insights into preferred amenities and itineraries. 

### Airbnb: Predicting Listing Prices
- Tuned multiple Neural Network models to predict the listing prices of Airbnbs in Washington D.C.. Compared results with linear regression output to determine the pros and cons of investing time into the development of the neural network model. Performed in-depth analysis of feature importance to pose recommendations to hypothetical realty company. 

### Canterra: Preventing Employee Attrition
- Identified key predictors of employee attrition using logistic regression and posed recommendations to reduce Canterra's employee turnover rate to below 15%.
